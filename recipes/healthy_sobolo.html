    <h1>Sobolo - Spicy Hibiscus Drink</h1>
<div>
    <h4>Sobolo is popular across several countries and continents; for example,<br>
        in Nigeria, it is known as zobo and is made slightly different from how <br>
        it is made here in Ghana and a delightful kick that'll have you coming back over and over</h5>

    <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash, peel, and cut pineapple into chunks, blend, and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a pot, add your Sobolo leaves, lemon, skin of the pineapple, cloves,<br>
            grains of selim, ginger, dried pepper and Prekese.</li>
        <li>Add blended pineapple and the desired amount of water.<br>
            I used about 3 cups of the medium-sized calabash</li>
        <li> Cover and bring to a boil on medium heat for about 10 minutes</li>
        <li>Drain the Sobolo juice using a fine sieve or Cheesecloth. Some people <br>
            prefer to drain their Sobolo twice or thrice for extra smoothness.</li>
        <li>Allow it to cool completely before adding a sweetener. Sugar, honey,<br>
            or another sweetener option can work but to keep it healthier using a fruit as a sweetener is ideal.</li>
        <li>Keep refrigerated and serve chilled</li>
    </ol>
